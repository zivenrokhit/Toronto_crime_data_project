# Toronto Police Data Spatial Analysis and Machine Learning

This project involves analyzing data from the Toronto Police API to generate a spatial map and evaluate various machine learning models.

## Overview

The project retrieves crime data from the [Toronto Police API](https://www.torontopolice.on.ca/data/), processes it to create a spatial map, and applies several machine learning models to the data for analysis and prediction.

## Features

- Fetches and preprocesses crime data from the Toronto Police API.
- Generates a spatial map visualizing crime incidents across Toronto.
- Implements and tests various machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/toronto-police-ml-project.git
   cd toronto-police-ml-project
